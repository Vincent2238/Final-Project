Project Title
AI-Powered Health Monitoring for Preventive Care (SDG 3)

2. SDG Focus
Goal:
SDG 3 – Good Health and Well-Being

Problem Statement:
Many individuals—especially in low-resource or rural areas—lack access to proactive health monitoring tools. Delayed detection of issues like arrhythmia or oxygen deficiency can lead to avoidable complications or death.

3. AI Approach
Software Engineering Skills Applied:

Automation:
ML automates the analysis of real-time biometric data from wearables.

Testing:
Unit and integration tests ensure model reliability and accurate alerting.

Scalability:
Modular Python code structure enables easy deployment and future feature integration.

Technical Solution:

Use Isolation Forest or LSTM models to detect anomalies in heart rate and blood oxygen levels.

Provide personalized health recommendations via a Flask or mobile-based app.

Store and process data securely for continuous learning and feedback loops.

4. Tools & Frameworks
AI/ML: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras (for time-series modeling)

Software Engineering: Git + GitHub, Docker, Flask

Deployment: Azure or Google Cloud + REST API

Data Sources:

Simulated wearable data

Public health datasets like PhysioNet or Kaggle’s biometric data

5. Deliverables
✅ Codebase: Python scripts and Jupyter Notebooks (modular + commented)

✅ Prototype: Flask-based app to display health metrics and alerts

✅ Report:

SDG alignment

Ethical compliance

System architecture

Performance metrics

✅ Presentation: Slides summarizing problem, solution, outcomes

6. Ethical & Sustainability Checks
Bias Mitigation:
Audit datasets to ensure balanced representation across age, gender, and medical conditions.

Environmental Impact:
Optimize model size and inference speed; deploy light models for edge devices.

Scalability & Inclusion:
Design with responsive UI and offline functionality to reach users in low-connectivity zones.

Ethical AI Design	Flag data biases, provide transparent explanations for anomalies
Modular Code	Separate data, model, and API layers for easy updates and scaling

9. Reflection Questions
How does this align with SDG 3?
It offers a low-cost, AI-based tool for early disease detection, helping prevent health crises.

Ethical risks & mitigation?
Risk of false alarms or misdiagnosis → addressed via extensive testing and human-in-the-loop design.

How do software practices help?
Good documentation, versioning, and testing ensure long-term reliability and user trust.

10. Why This Works
